Window to the World is a window that watches you. It learns your preferences and shows you what you want to see. It gives you more of what you like and less of what you don’t.

Inspired by Jorge Luis Borges' short stories, The Aleph and The Garden of Forking Paths, Window to the World is a preference engine as described by Alan Turing in a note addressed to Lady Ada Lovelace in his 1950 paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence. 

Window to the World is available as a public preview release here:
